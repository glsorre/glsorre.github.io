  I am a **t-shaped developer** with more than 5 years experience.
  

  I have received my first Personal Computer, based on 8086 in far 1990, I was 8. **From there I always coded**, even though I spent half of my career between Design, UX and Agile positions before coming back to my first love.


  I am proficient in many different technologies even though I give my best on frontend development.


  **Right Right is my personal brand**. It's a space where creating digital products taking into account design, management, and coding.
