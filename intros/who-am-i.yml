  I am [Giuseppe Sorrentino](https://linkedin.com/in/glsorrentino) and I started
  my career as a **UX designer**. I have a strong passion for wireframing, then
  slowly transform them into high-fidelity prototypes.


  Often to **communicate your ideas to developers is not easy**, as they tend to
  simplify and schematize your concept. So I wondered: *"how can I communicate
  better with the development team?"*


  I had to **move a step in their direction, understand their problems and their
  way of thinking**.


  That is where I discovered agile and coding and fell in love with the idea of
  **creating digital experiences taking into account design, management, and
  coding.**
