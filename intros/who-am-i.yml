  I'm a **seasoned software developer** with a decade of experience specializing
  in crafting innovative user interfaces.


  **My expertise lies in front-end development**, where I excel in analyzing
  requirements and designing customized technical solutions using React,
  SingleSPA, Mobx, and other leading frameworks. I seamlessly integrate frontend
  and backend technologies to ensure optimal user experiences.


  My journey began when I received my first Personal Computer, based on the
  8086, at the age of 8. Despite spending half of my career in Design, UX, and
  Agile positions, **I returned to my first love, coding**.


  **I proudly manage my personal brand**, Right Right, where I create digital
  products by harmonizing design, management, and coding aspects
